// 1. Create an empty array called menagerie.


// 2. Create an eagle object with properties to describe the name/type of animal, num of legs, kind of skin, and natural habitat. Also provide it a matingCall method that displays an appropriate string in the console. Put this eagle into the menagerie.


// 3. Create similar objects as above, but using a constructor function called Animal, that accepts all the needed properties to create an object that has the same properties as the eagle. Then use this constructor function to create a whale, a centipede and a turkey, all to be added to the menagerie;


// 4. Finally, create a class to create a similar object to those already created above, and call it ClassyAnimal which also has the same properties as Animal, and also has a constructor that behaves just like the one in Animal. The matingCall method needs to be shared across all the ClassyAnimal objects. Then create an ocelot, a peacock, and a corgi object with this class, also added to the menagerie.


// 5. Then make only those animals in the menagerie that have 2 legs display their mating calls.


// 6. Then make a copy of the menagerie called circus, and but change the names of all the animals in circus so that the names are spelled backwards. Confirm that you have only changed the animal names in circus, and not the original menagerie.


// 7. Display all the animals, sorted alphabetically by name in the following format:
// ["The Centipede's habitat is the forest", "The Corgi's habitat is the land", "The Eagle's habitat is the air", ...]

// BONUS: Can you do #7 with only 'console.log(menagerie)'?
