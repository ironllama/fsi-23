# Create a variable called tongue_twister, assign your favorite tongue twister to that variable as a string.

# Then, create a variable called count, assign a number between 2 and 1,000 to that variable.

# Print out the uppercase version of that tongue twister repeated count number of times.

# Assign that repeated string to a new variable called tongue_twisters.

# Print the lowercase version of that variable's (tongue_twisters) value.

# Then, print the result of multiplying the length of that variable's value by 15,000.

# Reassign the value of tongue_twister to be the string 'haha'.

# Reassign the value of tongue_twisters to be the number 9000.

# Combine the two variables into a single string using an f-string

# Print the result. (eg. 'haha9000')


# Write a Python program to get a string from a given string where all occurrences of its first char have been changed to '$', except the first char itself.
# Sample String : 'restart'
# Expected Result : 'resta$t'
