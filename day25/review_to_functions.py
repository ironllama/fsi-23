# 1. Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or
#     odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. If the number is a
#     multiple of 4, print out yet a different message.


# 2. Use the following list and write a function that prints out all the
#     elements of the list that are less than 5.
arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

#    b. Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that
#        has all the elements from arr that are less than 5 and print
#        out this new list.


# 3. Create a function that asks the user for a number and then prints out a
#     list of all the divisors of that number.


# 4. Use the following lists and write a function that returns a new list that
#     contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without 
#     duplicates).
arr1 = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]


# 5. Write a function that asks the user for a string and prints out whether
#     this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that
#     reads the same forwards and backwards.)
